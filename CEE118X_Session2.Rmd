**Remember to set working directory on the bottom right corner 
**Stored at GitHub libill1997 folder 
**commit to main on github desktop app - then hit publish branch - remember to hit refresh
** Then the file will uploaded to the website
** https://libill1997.github.io/CEE118X_Session2.html <- that is your website. 
** For the assignment, send the link. 

Use command + option + i to insert a new chunk

```{r}
library(tidyverse) #you can use library() to check what packages you have
health_full <- read_csv("https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/swc5-untb/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD&bom=true&format=true") #use command enter 

head(health_full) #use head to see data summary 
```
* Use -> install.packages("tidyverse") you can install in your console. 
*use write_csv(health_full, "file path")
```{r}
write_csv(health_full, "health_full.csv") #you don't have to set up file path in this case because your working directory is set as github folder. 
```

```{r}
health_full_again <- read_csv("health_full.csv") #you read the file from local csv file

rm(health_full_again) #to remove file from global environment 
```

*Set up for Assignment 1 PG&E
*use loop to combine all 4 csv into 1 csv
```{r}

    "PGE_",
    year,
    "_Q",
    quarter,
    "_",
    type,
    "UsageByZip.csv"
  )
  print(filename)
  temp<-read_csv(filename) #made all 4 quarters of PGE data into one csv

}


```

```{r}
pge_filter<- filter(pge_20_elec, CUSTOMERCLASS %in% c("Elec- Residential", "Elec- Commercial") ) # %in% means include items of interest under CUSTOMERCLASS category, in this class we only interested in data having Elect residential and Elec commercial 

```

```{r} 
#Use Select to remove or keep main categories from a file 
names(pge_filter) #show the available categories

head(pge_filter) #show the available categories along with few rows of data

```

```{r}
pge_filter[1,1] #use [ ] to see the row and columns
```

```{r} 
pge_filter[1:5, 1:5] # First term represents row, second term is column
```

```{r}
pge_filter[1:5, c("ZIPCODE","MONTH", "YEAR")] #5 rows but only three columns of desire categories, c() basically allows you to create desire vectors.
```

```{r}
pge_filter[1:5,] #only 5 rows but display all categories
```

```{r}
pge_filter[1:5,]$YEAR #display 5 columns of data under category YEAR
```

```{r}
pge_select<- 
  select(
    pge_filter,
    ZIPCODE,
    MONTH,
    CUSTOMERCLASS,
    COMBINED,
    TOTALCUSTOMERS,
    TOTALKWH,
    AVERAGEKWH
  )
#Select all categories from pge_filter
pge_select<- select(pge_filter, -YEAR) # use -Year to get rid of year column from pge_filter
```

```{r}

```

```{r}
pge_select<- select(
  pge_filter,

```

```{r}
pge_group<- group_by(
  pge_select,
  MONTH,
  CUSTOMERCLASS
) #group month and customerclass together for the next operation
```

```{r}
pge_summarize<- summarize(pge_group,

                            sum(TOTALKWH, na.rm=T))
#Although the group_by function did not change the data in the global environment. summarize() recognized the group_by() to create two columns with just MONTH and CUSTOMERCLASS.
#Since you also add TOTALKWH, it will also retain the category. sum() takes all values of TOTALKWH from the pge_group that share the same MONTH and CUSTOMERCLASS and add them together. 
#na.rm= T gets rid of empty fields, generally should be included. 
```
*This is considered tidying the data --> tidyverse

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
